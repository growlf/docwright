# Phase 3 — Vault Portability, Real-World Pilot & Upstream Contribution Pipeline

## Overview

Establishes the foundational infrastructure DocWright needs before any real work can be trusted: a vault write API that maintains referential integrity across all file moves, a unified document index that covers both frontmatter relationships and body-text wikilinks, and a knowledge graph that makes the structure of work visible before problems compound. These three items land before the pilots run.

Then delivers the real-world pilots (MSP + Cascade STEAM early-access) against that foundation, proving DocWright can be adopted on any external vault with no manual file edits and no stale references.

The contribution pipeline (`contribution-pipeline`) is in-progress but does not gate Phase 3 — it runs in parallel and closes in Phase 5.

See [[proposals/approved/phase-vault-portability-pilot.md]] for the original design rationale.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 2 gate review by NetYeti must complete before this plan begins.

## Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Sub-Plan Proposal | Status |
|---|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | TypeScript MCP Server with `--mode` flag | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-ts-mcp-server.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Vault Portability Foundation (path resolution + .mcp.json) | [[proposals/sub-plan-vault-portability-foundation.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 3 | `docwright init` scaffold | [[proposals/sub-plan-docwright-init-scaffold.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Profile override merge engine | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-profile-override-merge.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Vault migration system (`MIGRATION.md` + `vault:migrate`) | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-vault-migration-system.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Contribution pipeline & friction log | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-contribution-pipeline.md]] | 🔀 In progress — moved to Phase 5 (5e); does not gate Phase 3 |
| 7 | MSP pilot vault (non-profit managed services) | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-msp-pilot-vault.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Cascade STEAM early-access vault | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-cascade-steam-early-access.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 9 | Architecture boundary document (`docs/vault-portability.md`) | [[proposals/sub-plan-architecture-boundary-doc.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 10 | `docwright adopt` — existing vault adoption tooling | [[proposals/approved/docwright-adopt-existing-vault.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 11 | Vault Write API (moveDocument, renameDocument, canonical setField) | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-vault-write-api.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 12 | Vault Document Index (unified frontmatter + wikilink edges) | [[proposals/approved/sub-plan-vault-document-index.md]] | ✅ Done |
| 13 | Knowledge Graph (D3 force-directed, 4th status tab, gap detection) | [[proposals/approved/knowledge-graph-cross-document-idea-linkage.md]] | ✅ Done — proposal approval pending; KG tuning continues on dedicated branch |

**Ordering:** Deliverables 11 → 12 → 13 must land before pilots (7, 8). Everything else can run in parallel around that spine. Deliverable 6 runs independently and closes in Phase 5.

## Implementation Steps

| Step | Action | Details | Status | Issue | Branch |
|------|--------|---------|--------| --- | --- |
| 1 | Vault-portable TypeScript MCP server with `--mode` flag | Rewrite `scripts/mcp-server.py` in TypeScript. `DOCWRIGHT_VAULT_ROOT` env var is first-class config. `--mode upstream` flag switches the server to target DocWright's own repo instead of the vault. Zero hard-coded paths. Replaces Python server; remove Python from Dockerfile. Parity test: all existing tools pass against both vault and upstream modes. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 2 | Contribution pipeline tools on dw-upstream | **Delegated to `plans/contribution-pipeline.md`** — that plan is the authoritative spec for Steps 1–3 (contribute_upstream, log_friction, list_docwright_issues). See sub-plan for full details. Does not gate Phase 3. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 3 | Path resolution — no hardcoded paths | `docwright init` writes `.env` with `DOCWRIGHT_PATH` as first step. All vault-side files reference `$DOCWRIGHT_PATH` — never absolute paths. Update `.claude/settings.json` hook commands to use `$DOCWRIGHT_PATH`. Hook install script: `npm run hook:install -- --vault /path`. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 4 | `.mcp.json` template | Define `.mcp.json` template wiring `dw-vault` (vault mode) and `dw-upstream` (upstream mode). Both reference `$DOCWRIGHT_PATH`. Template generated by `docwright init`. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 5 | `docwright init` scaffold | `npm run init -- --dest /path/to/new-vault --profile org-operations` creates full vault structure, `.docwright/config.json`, `.env`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, pre-commit hook, `profile.json` stub, `docs/friction-log.md`. Must work end-to-end: init → open in web UI → create proposal → approve → create plan. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 6 | `vault:migrate` script + `MIGRATION.md` | Define `MIGRATION.md` schema (per-version BREAKING sections with migration commands). Implement `npm run vault:migrate -- --vault /path --from X --to Y`: reads `MIGRATION.md`, applies steps in version range, updates `.docwright/config.json`, never touches vault content. Write first `MIGRATION.md` entry. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 7 | Profile override merge | Profile engine reads vault-root `profile.json` and merges onto bundled profile: scalars replace, objects deep-merge, `+array` appends, unprefixed array replaces. Test: MSP vault adds one required field without losing bundled defaults. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 8 | MSP pilot vault | Real-world adoption validated via bms-ai-cluster (`npm run adopt`, 2026-06-24) and csdocs/Cascade STEAM (`npm run adopt`, 2026-06-23). Both vaults run against the Phase 3 architecture with zero hardcoded paths. csdocs serves as the primary case study. ai-stack adoption pending (not a Phase 3 gate). | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 9 | Cascade STEAM early-access vault | `csdocs` vault at `/home/netyeti/Projects/csdocs` adopted 2026-06-23 (v0.4.2, lightweight mode). org-operations profile, 4 core policy stubs, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json` all present. Web UI accessible via `DOCWRIGHT_ROOT=/home/netyeti/Projects/csdocs`. Leadership to complete mission/vision/governance/values stubs and submit first proposal — vault is technically ready. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 10 | Friction log tooling | **Delegated to `plans/contribution-pipeline.md` Step 2.** See sub-plan for full details (log_friction MCP tool, docs/friction-log.md structure, periodic review cadence). | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 11 | Architecture boundary document | `docs/vault-portability.md` written covering: three adoption modes, manifest upgrade contract, js-yaml baked-path approach, moving vaults between machines, CI usage, DOCWRIGHT_ROOT vs DOCWRIGHT_VAULT_ROOT. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 12 | Vault Write API | `moveDocument(src, dest)`, `renameDocument(path, newName)`, `setDocumentField(path, field, value)` implemented in `src/dispatch/vault-write.ts`. Full rollback on failure, wikilink cascade, cross-ref update, write-audit.jsonl. `fix-stale-approvals.ts` marked @deprecated — approve/rename endpoints wired to canonical API. 13 tests passing. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 13 | Vault Document Index | `buildIndex`, `readIndex`, `writeIndex`, `rebuildIfStale`, `getBacklinksFor`, `queryDocuments` implemented in `src/dispatch/vault-index.ts`. `/api/graph` and `/api/vault/query` live. SSE wires index rebuild on file change. Two test files (24 tests). Proposal `approved: true`. | ✅ Done | — | — |
| 14 | Knowledge Graph | `KnowledgeGraph.svelte` (580 lines) and `GraphView.svelte` (228 lines) implemented. D3 force-directed, 4th status tab, 6 gap-detection categories, filter sidebar. Wired into status page. Proposal code-complete but `approved: false` — NetYeti to approve `proposals/approved/knowledge-graph-cross-document-idea-linkage.md`. Tuning continues on dedicated `feat/knowledge-graph` branch tracking develop. | ✅ Done | — | — |

## Real-World Pilot: DAFO Infrastructure Vault (2026-06-16)

*First unplanned external vault adoption. Garth Johnson (growlf / Cascade Steam Technology) used DocWright to scaffold and version-control an existing Obsidian client vault for DAFO, a non-profit serving the public good. Documents discoveries that directly inform Steps 8, 9, and 11.*

### What was done

An existing Obsidian vault (`~/Obsidian/DAFO`) containing client notes, project logs, system documentation, and six newly-written infrastructure proposals was adopted into DocWright governance and pushed to a new private GitHub repo (`growlf/dafo-infrastructure`).

The vault was **not** a fresh directory — `docwright init` was therefore blocked. The full adoption was performed manually in a single session, producing the following deliverables:
- 6 fully critiqued infrastructure proposals (critique cycle, effort estimates, DocWright frontmatter)
- Cover letter and engagement summary
- Complete DocWright directory scaffold
- Pre-commit hook validation passing
- Private GitHub repo with all sensitive Obsidian content gitignored

### Gaps discovered (directly actionable for Steps 8, 9, 11)

| Gap | Severity | Current Workaround | Proposed Fix |
|-----|---------|--------------------|--------------|
| `init.ts` refuses non-empty directories | 🚫 **Resolved** | `npm run adopt` — three-mode adoption (open/lightweight/full), manifest-based upgrade contract | `scripts/adopt-vault.ts` shipped; bms-ai-cluster + DAFO validated — see [[plans/completed/plan-script-skill-docwright-adopt-initialize-docwright-on-existing-vaults.md]] |
| Pre-commit hook required `js-yaml` in vault's `node_modules` | ⚠️ **Resolved** | Baked absolute path via `sed` substitution in `install-hooks.sh` at install time | Fixed in `install-hooks.sh`; no symlink needed; documented in `docs/vault-portability.md` |
| `.docwright/.gitignore` silently blocks `config.json` and itself from staging — confusing | ⚠️ Warn | Force-add or just don't add them (they're intentionally local) | Clarify in `docs/vault-portability.md` that only `registry.example.json` is committed |
| Non-proposal markdown in `proposals/` (e.g. cover letters, SOW docs) must carry full proposal frontmatter or the hook rejects them | ⚠️ Warn | Added minimal frontmatter with `type: proposal` | Loosen hook to allow `type: document` or similar non-lifecycle type in `proposals/` |
| No status migration path — existing notes using `status: pending` fail validation | ⚠️ Warn | Manual sed/python pass across all files | `adopt-vault.ts` should normalise status values during adoption |
| Sensitive Obsidian vault content (Dailys, system docs, stack files) needs gitignore before first commit — not guided | ⚠️ Warn | Manual `.gitignore` construction | `adopt-vault.ts` should audit existing content and generate a protective gitignore interactively |

### What worked well

- `npm run hook:install -- --vault /path` worked perfectly on a pre-existing git repo
- Profile override merge and `.mcp.json` template applied without issues
- The `docwright-raw-proposal` skill pattern (even applied manually) produced solid, critiqued proposals from vault notes in a single session
- Git + GitHub private repo creation via `gh` CLI integrated cleanly

### Implications for upcoming steps

- **Step 8 (MSP pilot):** `npm run adopt` now handles existing repos — no longer blocked by `init.ts` refusing non-empty directories. Run `npm run adopt -- --dest /path/to/msp-vault --mode full`.
- **Step 9 (Cascade STEAM early access):** `bms-ai-cluster` was adopted as Phase 3 validation test (June 2026) using `npm run adopt`. Cascade STEAM can follow the same process.
- **Step 11 (Architecture boundary doc):** `docs/vault-portability.md` was written as part of the adopt-vault plan — covers all three modes, manifest upgrade contract, js-yaml baked-path, CI usage. ✅ Done.
